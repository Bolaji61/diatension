                    Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure,
                    is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. 
                    Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. 
                    Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is 
                    created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as 
                    it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure the harder the heart has to pump.
                    <br><br>
                    Narrow arteries increase resistance. 
                    The narrower your arteries are, the higher your blood pressure will be. 
                    Over the long term, increased pressure can cause health issues, including heart disease.
                    <br>
                    Hypertension is quite common and it typically develops over the course of several years. 
                    Usually, you don’t notice any symptoms. But even without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause 
                    damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys.
                    Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure readings can help you and your doctor notice 
                    any changes. If your blood pressure is elevated, your doctor may have you check your blood pressure
                    over a few weeks to see if the number stays elevated or falls back to normal levels.
                    Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription medication and healthy lifestyle changes. 
                    If the condition isn’t treated, it could lead to health issues, including heart attack and stroke.

                                Hypertension is generally a silent condition. 
                                Many people won’t experience any symptoms. That's why it's so important to have your 
                                blood pressure checked on a regular basis (during all visits to your doctor or diabetes nurse) 
                                and to follow your doctor’s recommendations on home blood pressure monitoring.
                                It may take years or even decades for the condition to reach levels 
                                severe enough that symptoms become obvious. Even then, 
                                these symptoms may be attributed to other issues.
                                Symptoms of severe hypertension can include:

                        These symptoms require immediate medical attention. They don’t occur in everyone with hypertension, 
                        but waiting for a symptom of this condition to appear could be fatal.
                        <br><br>
                        If you have a family history of heart disease or have risk factors for developing the condition, 
                        your doctor may recommend that you have your blood pressure checked twice a year. 
                        This helps you and your doctor stay on top of any possible issues before they become problematic

                            When is it high blood pressure?
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                If you have high blood pressure, it means that your blood is pumping through your heart and blood vessels with too much force. 
                                Over time, consistently high blood pressure tires the heart muscle and can enlarge.
                                In the general population and in people with diabetes, a blood pressure reading of less 
                                than 120/80 mm Hg is considered normal.<br>
                                What does this mean? The first number (120) is called the systolic pressure. It indicates 
                                the highest pressure exerted as blood pushes through your heart. The second number (80) is 
                                called the diastolic pressure. This is the pressure maintained by the arteries when the vessels 
                                are relaxed between heartbeats.

                            High blood pressure during pregnancy
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                An older study from 2003 has shown that women who have gestational diabetes are more likely 
                                to have high blood pressure. However, women who manage their
                                blood sugar levels during pregnancy are less likely to experience high blood pressure.
                                <br><br>
                                If you develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, your doctor will monitor your urine protein levels. High urine protein levels may be a sign of preeclampsia. This is a type of high blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy. 
                                Other markers in the blood may also lead to a diagnosis. These markers include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>abnormal liver enzymes</li>
                                        <li>abnormal kidney function</li>
                                        <li>low platelet count</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <br><br>
                                Women with hypertension can deliver healthy babies despite having the condition. 
                                But it can be dangerous to both mother and baby 
                                if it’s not monitored closely and managed during the pregnancy.
                                <br><br>
                                Women with high blood pressure are more likely to develop complications.
                                 For example, pregnant women with hypertension may experience decreased kidney function. 
                                Babies born to mothers with hypertension may have a low birth weight or be born prematurely.

                                Some women may develop hypertension during their pregnancies. Several types of high blood 
                                pressure problems can develop. 
                                The condition often reverses itself once the baby is born. 
                                Developing hypertension during pregnancy may increase your risk for developing 
                                hypertension later in life.

                                </h5>
                                In some cases, pregnant women with hypertension may develop preeclampsia during their pregnancy. 
                                This condition of increased blood pressure can cause kidney and other organ complications. This can result in high protein levels in the urine, problems with liver function, fluid in the lungs, or visual problems.
                                As this condition worsens, the risks increase for the mother and baby. Preeclampsia can lead 
                                to eclampsia, which causes seizures. High blood pressure problems in pregnancy remain an important

                                    Because hypertension is often a silent condition, it can cause damage to your body for years before 
                                    symptoms
                                     become obvious. If hypertension isn’t treated, you may face serious, even fatal, complications.

                <h3>Complications of hypertension include the following:</h3>
                    <h5>
                        Damaged arteries
                    </h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Healthy arteries are flexible and strong. Blood flows freely and unobstructed through healthy arteries and vessels.
                                        <br>
                                        Hypertension makes arteries tougher, tighter, and less elastic. This damage makes it easier for 
                                        dietary fats to 
                                        deposit in your arteries and restrict blood flow. This damage can lead to increased blood pressure, 
                                        blockages, and, eventually, heart attack and stroke.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <h5>
                                            Damaged heart

                                        Hypertension makes your heart work too hard. 
                                        The increased pressure in your blood vessels forces your 
                                        heart’s muscles to pump more frequently and with more force than a healthy heart should have to.

                                        This may cause an enlarged heart. An enlarged heart increases your risk for the following:

                                        Your brain relies on a healthy supply of oxygen-rich blood to work properly. 
                                        High blood pressure can reduce your brain’s supply of blood:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Temporary blockages of blood flow to the brain are called transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).</li>
                                                <li>Significant blockages of blood flow cause brain cells to die. This is known as a stroke.</li>
                                            </ul>   
                                        Uncontrolled hypertension may also affect your memory and ability to learn, recall, 
                                        speak, and reason. Treating hypertension often doesn’t erase or reverse the effects of 
                                        uncontrolled hypertension. It does, however, lower the risks for future problems.

                                    After those two weeks, aim to add one more serving. 
                                    The goal is to have ten servings of fruits and vegetables per day.

                        <p>
                            Instead of having meat and three sides, create a dish that uses meat as a condiment. 
                            In other words, instead of eating a steak with a side salad, eat a bigger salad and top it 
                            with a smaller portion of steak.

                            Try to incorporate fewer sugar-sweetened foods, including flavored yogurts, 
                            cereals, and sodas. Packaged foods hide unnecessary sugar, so be sure to read labels.

                        <p>
                          Instead of an arbitrary goal to “lose weight,” talk with your doctor about a healthy weight for you.  
                          Then decide on what physical activity you can start in order to reach that goal. 
                          If exercising five nights a week is too hard to work into your schedule, aim for one more night than what you’re doing right now. 
                          When that fits comfortably into your schedule, add another night.

                            The best way to prevent complications and avoid problems is to catch hypertension early. 
                            You can come into your doctor’s office for a blood pressure reading, or your doctor may ask you to 
                            purchase a blood pressure cuff and take readings at home.

                            Keep a log of your blood pressure readings and take it to your regular doctor appointments.
                            This can help your doctor see any possible problems before the condition advances.

                                <p>
                                    ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are a group of drugs that are often used to treat high blood pressure in people with diabetes. Although other high blood pressure medications are available, ACE inhibitors have been shown to not only to be a useful drug to treat high blood pressure, but have been shown to prevent or delay the progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes.

                                    Other medications used to treat high blood pressure in people with diabetes include a class of drugs called diuretics (‘water pills’).
                                        
                                    Because adequate control of blood pressure usually requires more than one medication, most doctors use ACE inhibitors first then add other anti-hypertension drugs if necessary.

                            A heart-healthy diet is vital for helping to reduce high blood pressure. It’s also important for managing hypertension that is under control and reducing the risk of complications. 
                            These complications include heart disease, stroke, and heart attack.
                            <br><br>
                            A heart-healthy diet emphasizes foods that include:

                             Increasing physical activity
                        </h5>
                        Reaching a healthy weight should include being more physically active. 
                        In addition to helping you shed pounds, exercise can help reduce stress, 
                        lower blood pressure naturally, and strengthen your cardiovascular system.
                        <br><br>
                        Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week. 
                        That’s about 30 minutes five times per week.

                        If you are overweight or obese, losing weight through a heart-healthy diet and 
                        increased physical activity can help lower your blood pressure.
                        <h5>
                            Managing stress
                        </h5>
                        Exercise is a great way to manage stress. Other activities can also be helpful. 
                        These include: <br><br>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        These are all proven stress-reducing techniques.
                        Getting adequate sleep can also help reduce stress levels.

                                            Alcohol can raise blood pressure.
                                            If you have diabetes, your doctor may check your blood pressure at least four times each year. 
                                            If you have diabetes and high blood pressure, it is recommended that you self-monitor at home, record the readings, 
                                            and share them with your doctor or visit the nearest clinic for checkup.
